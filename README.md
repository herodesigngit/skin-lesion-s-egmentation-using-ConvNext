# Skin Lesion Segmentation Using ConvNext

This repository contains a deep learning model that performs **skin lesion segmentation** using the **ConvNext** architecture.
The model is trained to identify and segment skin lesions in dermoscopic images, which can be useful for early diagnosis of skin cancer such as melanoma.

Dataset
This model is trained on the ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset. The dataset contains annotated dermoscopic images of various skin lesions, including benign and malignant cases.

You can download the dataset from the ISIC Archive.
